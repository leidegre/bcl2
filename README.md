# bcl2
A 2nd Generation Base Class Library (BCL) by an avid .NET ninja

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leidegre/bcl2.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/leidegre/bcl2)

This is a library of functions that hopefully extends the .NET Framework with useful stuff. In my experience, there are few things that cannot be found in the .NET Framework and this library is not meant to function as a replacement for anything which is already there. Instead, there are a few things that I find myself writing over and over again. Once perfected, I hope they will find there way into this library.
